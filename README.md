# MEBLinearSystems
Includes instructions and examples of solving systems of linear equations with computing software.

This repository is designed for use in Material and Energy Balances courses. The content was tested in CE 212: Fundamental Principles of Chemical Engineering at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York. Instructor: Dr. Ashlee N. Ford Versypt @ashleefv. Content provided here was developed by Dr. Ford Versypt and Austin N. Johns @austin-johns.

The course textbook is the Material and Energy Balances zyBook by Matthew Liberatore available from https://www.zybooks.com/catalog/material-and-energy-balances/.

The material developed here supplements the section in the zyBook titled Systems of linear equations, specifically as a MATLAB Live Script-based alternative to the subsection titled "Solving systems of linear equations in a spreadsheet." This main file is [Systems_of_Linear_Equations.mlx](https://github.com/ashleefv/MEBLinearSystems/blob/master/Systems_of_Linear_Equations.mlx), with a corresponding solution to the worked example available in [Systems_of_Linear_Equations_sol.mlx](https://github.com/ashleefv/MEBLinearSystems/blob/master/Systems_of_Linear_Equations_sol.mlx). We also have created an explanatory youtube video: [Solving Systems of Linear Equations Using a MATLAB Live Script](https://youtu.be/78n8XaCBt9w)
