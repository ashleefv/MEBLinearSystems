# MEBLinearSystems
Includes instructions and examples of solving systems of linear equations with computing software.

This repository is designed for use in CE 212: Fundamental Principles of Chemical Engineering at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York. Instructor: Dr. Ashlee N. Ford Versypt @ashleefv. Content provided here is developed by Dr. Ford Versypt and Austin Johns @austin-johns.

The course textbook is the Material and Energy Balances zyBook by Matthew Liberatore available from https://www.zybooks.com/catalog/material-and-energy-balances/.

The material developed here supplements the section in the zyBook titled Systems of linear equations, specifically as a MATLAB Live Script-based alternative to the subsection titled "Solving systems of linear equations in a a spreadsheet."
