# MEBLinearSystems
Includes instructions and examples of solving systems of linear equations with computing software.

This repository is designed for use in Material and Energy Balances courses. The content was tested in CE 212: Fundamental Principles of Chemical Engineering at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York. Instructor: Dr. Ashlee N. Ford Versypt @ashleefv. Content provided here was developed by Dr. Ford Versypt and Austin N. Johns @austin-johns.

The course textbook is the Material and Energy Balances zyBook by Matthew Liberatore available from https://www.zybooks.com/catalog/material-and-energy-balances/.

The material developed here supplements the section in the zyBook titled Systems of linear equations, specifically as a MATLAB Live Script-based alternative to the subsection titled "Solving systems of linear equations in a spreadsheet." This main file is [Systems_of_Linear_Equations.mlx](https://github.com/ashleefv/MEBLinearSystems/blob/master/Systems_of_Linear_Equations.mlx), with a corresponding solution to the interactive example available in [Systems_of_Linear_Equations_sol.mlx](https://github.com/ashleefv/MEBLinearSystems/blob/master/Systems_of_Linear_Equations_sol.mlx). We also have created an explanatory youtube video: [Solving Systems of Linear Equations Using a MATLAB Live Script](https://youtu.be/78n8XaCBt9w)
The interactive example section of [Systems_of_Linear_Equations.mlx](https://github.com/ashleefv/MEBLinearSystems/blob/master/Systems_of_Linear_Equations.mlx) can also be used as a template for solving other systems of linear equations, such as those encountered in homework assignments in Material and Energy Balances courses.

The file [Lecture_With_Examples.mlx](https://github.com/ashleefv/MEBLinearSystems/blob/master/Lecture_With_Examples.mlx) is intended to be used as a course lecture to introduce the topic to students, even before they have learned to do material balances. The lecture includes the explanatory text and worked examples from [Systems_of_Linear_Equations.mlx](https://github.com/ashleefv/MEBLinearSystems/blob/master/Systems_of_Linear_Equations.mlx) as well as 5 additional examples from three Material and Energy Balances textbooks:
1. M. W. Liberatore, Material and Energy Balances ZyBook. Electronic, interactive textbook: ZyBooks, 2019.
2. R. M. Felder, R. W. Rousseau, and L. G. Bullard, Elementary Principles of Chemical Processes, 4th ed. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2016.
